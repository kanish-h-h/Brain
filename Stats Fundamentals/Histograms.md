A **histogram** is a visual representation of the *distribution* of quantitative data. To construct a histogram, the first step is to ["bin" (or "bucket")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning "Data binning") the range of values— divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") of a variable. The bins (intervals) are adjacent and are typically (but not required to be) of equal size.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#cite_note-1)

Histograms give a rough sense of the density of the underlying distribution of the data, and often for [density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation "Density estimation"): estimating the [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function "Probability density function") of the underlying variable. The total area of a histogram used for probability density is always normalized to 1. If the length of the intervals on the _x_-axis are all 1, then a histogram is identical to a [relative frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_frequency "Relative frequency") plot.

Histograms are sometimes confused with [bar charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_chart "Bar chart"). In a histogram, each bin is for a different range of values, so altogether the histogram illustrates the distribution of values. But in a bar chart, each bar is for a different category of observations (e.g., each bar might be for a different population), so altogether the bar chart can be used to compare different categories. Some authors recommend that bar charts always have gaps between the bars to clarify that they are not histograms.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#cite_note-3)
