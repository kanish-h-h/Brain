_"I want to implement a deep learning-based project from scratch using Python and TensorFlow/PyTorch. The project involves **[task name]** (e.g., image super-resolution, text generation, reinforcement learning, etc.)._

### **What I need from you:**

1️⃣ **First, provide a complete plan** of what we are about to do in detail, including:

- A **structured roadmap** breaking down the project into logical steps.
- **Prerequisites** (concepts, tools, dependencies) I need to know before starting.
- A list of **all components** we will implement as we progress.

2️⃣ **Step-by-step guidance** throughout the implementation, ensuring I understand each part.

3️⃣ **Use Google Colab with GPU** for training and make sure to:

- Properly utilize **GPU acceleration**.
- Save **weights, checkpoints, and models** for later use.

4️⃣ **Explain any new methodology concisely** whenever we introduce it in the project.

- If we use an advanced technique (e.g., Residual Blocks, Attention Mechanisms, GANs, etc.), provide a **short definition** before implementing it.

5️⃣ **Ensure the final implementation is structured and production-ready:**

- Start with a **small dataset or single example** for testing.
- Scale it up to a **full-fledged version** that can be converted into a **GitHub repository**.
- Optimize it for **real-world use, deployment, or integration into an API/app** (if applicable).

### **End goal:**

✅ A complete, well-structured system that is easy to scale, improve, and deploy.  
✅ A clear understanding of every methodology used.  
✅ A final implementation that follows best practices.

Let’s begin with **Step 1: What is our detailed plan, prerequisites, and roadmap for this project?**"
