- Hello World of the Machine Learning.
- Learn different algorithms and implementation, such as
	- Decision Tree
	- Random Forest
	- Support Vector Machine
- Gateway for using different algorithms and using EDA over this dataset
- Introductory project good for starting
- Make sure to plot multiple graphs i.e. EDA
