## 2. Where to Start?

1. Python
	1. jupyter notebooks
	2. Programming fundamentals
		1. basic syntax
		2. variables, math, if/else, loops, printing
		3. Data Types (str, int, float, booleans, list, dictionaries)
		4. Function classes and objects
		5. Modules, packages and importing
	3. Pandas Tutorial
2. First Data Analyst Project 
	5. python + pandas
	6. only analyse the data (any data)
	7. Goal: To come up with the hypothesis of the data, and start storytelling with graphs
3. Essential math for Machine Learning
	1. Basic Statistic and Probability (book: ISLP_website)

	2. Linear Algebra Fundamentals
	3. Calculus
4. Core ML concepts and Algorithms 
	1. Simple Algorithms
	> Linear, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest

## The Genius Move
- For each algo that you learn:
	- Implement it from scratch (basic Python)
	- Implement it using scikit-learn using a toy dataset
	- Use both your own implementation and scikit-learn on a real dataset.

## New ML Project
- Research the industry
- Look at the data
- Make some hypotheses about what might influence your target
- Look at correlation and scatter plots of different variables
- Design new features based on your knowledge of the problem
- Start with Simple algorithms (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression & Decision Trees)
- FINALLY: more complex algorithms (RF, Boosting, SVM)

## Don't Know what to work on?
- Start with a tutorial 
- Add/Change some features, change some features
- Swap out the dataset
- Try to break your code and then fix it
- Don't get stuck in...

---
## Advanced Topics
- Deep learning architectures
- CNNs for computer vision
- RNNs for sequential data
- Transformers for NLP
- Advanced optimization techniques 
- Model deployment strategies
- Latest research papers
- *Learn these by need, not by FOMO!*

## Do's and Don'ts

- ❌ Don't
	- Get stuck in tutorial hell
	- try to memorize everything
	- learn in isolation
	- chase every new trend
	- copy-paste code without understanding
	- try to learn every new fancy tool or research paper

- ✔️ Instead
	- Build real projects
	- focus on understanding 
	- share your progress 
	- join communities
	- Master fundamentals first
	- Implement from scratch 
	- learn by doing
