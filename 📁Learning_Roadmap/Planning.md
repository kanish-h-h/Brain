## ðŸ“‚ **How to Use This Plan in Obsidian**

1. **Create Separate Notes for Each Phase:**
    
    - Use the folder structure like `/Learning Plan/Phase 1/Week 1`.
    - Each day can have its own note with tasks, resources, and progress logs.
2. **Utilize Tags:**
    
    - Tag notes with `#python`, `#ML`, `#math`, `#gaming`.
3. **Link Notes:**
    
    - Backlink related topics, e.g., `[Python Resources](Python.md)`.
4. **Add Progress Trackers:**
    
    - Use checkboxes:
        - [ ] Day 1: Python Basics
        - [ ] Day 2: Advanced Python
        
        
5. **Embed Resources:**
    
    - Include links to articles, videos, or your GitHub repos for quick access.
