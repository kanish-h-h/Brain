### Strings
Strings are created by putting a sequence of characters in quotes.
Strings are immutable. `"Hello"`

```python
lang = """
	Python
	is
	good.
	"""
print(lang)
```

```python
str = "he"*4
print(str)
```
`output: hehehehe`

### Compilers
A compil[er is a computer program that transforms (translates) source code of a programming language into another computer language (the target language). 
In most cases compilers are used to transform source code into executable program, i.e. they translate code from high-level programming languages into low (or lower) level languages, mostly assembly or machine code.

### Interpreter
An interpreter is a computer program that executes instructions written in a programming language.
It can either execute the source code directly or translate the source code in a first step into a more efficient representation and execute this code.

### Input
