Memoisation is a technique used in computing to speed up programs. 
This is accomplished by memorizing the calculation results of processed input such as the results of function calls. 
If the same input or a function call with the same parameters is used, the previously stored results can be used again and unnecessary calculation are avoided, like dictionaries in Python.

Memoization can be explicitly programmed by the programmer, but some programming languages like Python provide mechanisms to automatically memoize functions.
