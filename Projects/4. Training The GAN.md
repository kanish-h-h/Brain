The goal is to train the generator to create outputs that are indistinguishable from real data which the discriminator improves at distinguishing real from fake.

## 4.1 Training Steps
For each training step:
1. **Discriminator Training:**
	- Use real data to calculate the loss for classifying real as 1.
	- Use fake data generated by the generator to calculate the loss for classifying fake as 0.
	- Update the discriminator's weights based on the combined loss.

2. **Generator Training:**
	- Generate fake data.
	- Calculate the generator's loss for fooling the discriminator (make fake look real)
	- Update the generator's weights
