### **Key Terms**:

- **Reels**:
  - Refers to the number of spinning reels on a slot machine. Mechanical reel slots usually have **three** reels, while video slots typically feature **five** reels.

- **Lines**:
  - The number of paylines a player can bet on. **Mechanical reel slots** often have a single payline, whereas **video slots** offer multiple paylines, enhancing the chances of winning combinations.

- **Scatter Wins**:
  - Games like **Lucky Larryâ€™s Lobstermania** and **Money Storm** offer scatter wins. Scatter wins occur when the scatter symbol lands **three, four, or five times** anywhere on the 3x5 grid, rather than needing to align on a payline.

- **Min/Max Wager**:
  - This indicates the **minimum** and **maximum** amount a player can bet per spin, providing flexibility depending on their risk tolerance.

- **Symbols per Reel**:
  - The total number of symbols that can appear on each reel during gameplay. More symbols generally reduce the odds of hitting specific combinations.

- **Payback Percentage (Payback %)**:
  - The percentage of the total wager that a player is expected to receive back, on average, over time. For example, a 95% payback percentage means that for every $100 wagered, players can expect to win back $95 over the long term.

- **Hit Frequency**:
  - This percentage represents how often a player will hit a winning combination per spin. For example, if the hit frequency is **8%**, a winning combination will occur approximately 8% of the time.

- **Plays per Jackpot**:
  - The average number of plays (spins) required to hit the jackpot. This helps gauge how rare winning the jackpot can be.

- **Jackpot Amount**:
  - The value of the highest possible prize a player can win, often tied to specific winning combinations or progressive jackpots.

- **Plays per Bonus**:
  - Indicates the average number of spins needed before triggering a **bonus mode** or special feature, such as free spins or bonus rounds.

### **Volatility Index (VI)**:
- **Volatility Index** indicates how much the game's payback percentage can fluctuate over a session of play. Games with higher volatility will experience greater swings in wins and losses compared to games with lower volatility.

  **Types of Volatility**:
  
  1. **Low Volatility**: 
     - Frequent, smaller wins. The gameplay is smoother and less risky, preserving bankroll over time.
  
  2. **Medium Volatility**:
     - A balance between low and high volatility. Offers moderate win frequency with decent-sized payouts.
  
  3. **High Volatility**: 
     - Larger, less frequent wins. Riskier gameplay, but with the potential for significant rewards. Players should be prepared for longer dry spells.

### **Other Terms**:

- **House Edge**:
  - This is the average percentage of each wager that the casino keeps as profit. In slots, the house edge is naturally built into the game. For example, in a game with a house edge, a $1 bet may only return $0.97 in winnings, meaning the casino retains 3%.

- **Return to Player (RTP)**:
  - RTP represents the percentage of total money wagered that the machine will return to players over time. For example, a 95% RTP means that over many spins, the machine will pay out $95 for every $100 wagered. The **higher the RTP**, the more favorable the game is for players. Note: Higher RTPs are usually associated with **lower volatility** (more frequent, smaller wins).

- **Hit Frequency**:
  - The term used to describe how often a slot machine lands on a winning combination. For instance, an 8% hit frequency means a winning combination occurs 8% of the time, on average. **Higher volatility games** typically have lower hit frequencies, while **lower volatility games** have higher hit frequencies.
