A random seed is used to ensure that results are reproducible.


**Properties of a Good Random Seed**
1. **Unpredictability**: A good random seed should be difficult to guess or predict, making it challenging for attackers to reproduce the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers.
2. **High Entropy**: The seed value should have high entropy, meaning it should contain a large amount of randomness and unpredictability.
3. **Unique**: Each seed value should be unique, avoiding collisions and ensuring that different seeds generate distinct sequences of pseudorandom numbers.
