You’ve got one week, so we’ll structure this as a **guided bootcamp-style roadmap**, blending **pre-reqs**, **daily goals**, **work methodology**, and **debug tips**—tailored to _you_, your stack (Dask/PySpark, Kafka/Flink, Isolation Forest + LSTM), and your outcome (production-quality project with GitHub+Docker). Ready? Buckle up. 🚀

# 🧠 Prerequisites You Must Know Before/While Starting

### ✅ Core Concepts

|Area|What to Know|
|---|---|
|**Time Series**|Trends, seasonality, sliding windows, lag features|
|**Anomaly Detection**|Unsupervised vs semi-supervised, concept drift|
|**Isolation Forest**|Tree-based isolation mechanism, fast baseline|
|**LSTM Autoencoder**|Encoder-decoder structure for reconstructing time sequences|
|**Big Data Tools**|Dask vs PySpark (lazy evaluation, partitioning, memory mgmt)|
|**Kafka & Flink**|Topics, brokers, producers, consumers, stream operators|
|**ML Ops**|CI/CD basics, experiment tracking (MLflow or wandb), Dockerization|

### ⚙️ Tooling to be Comfortable With

- `Docker`, `docker-compose`
    
- `pytest`, `pre-commit`, `GitHub Actions`
    
- `Jupyter`, `FastAPI`, `MLflow`
    
- `Dask` or `PySpark` (your choice, don’t mix both)
    
- `Kafka` and `Flink` (PyFlink or minimal Java config)

# 🧭 7-Day Structured Roadmap (with Time Allocation)

---

## 🗓️ **Day 1: Project Scaffolding + DevOps Setup**

### ✅ Goals:

- Create full repo structure from `/ml-project`
    
- Initialize Git, Docker, CI/CD
    
- Create dummy Kafka + Flink pipeline (non-functional prototype)
    

### 📁 Key Tasks:

-  Scaffold your repo (use your initial tree)
    
-  Add `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` for Kafka + Zookeeper + Flink
    
-  Setup `.github/workflows/tests.yml` for linting, `pytest`
    
-  Add `README.md` and `/docs/architecture.md` explaining planned system
    

### 📘 Study Topics:

- Docker networking basics
    
- Kafka producer/consumer fundamentals
    
- How GitHub Actions CI works
    

---

## 🗓️ **Day 2: Kafka & Flink Data Streaming**

### ✅ Goals:

- Simulate IoT data stream from CSV using Kafka
    
- Flink consumes and writes to `data/processed/` (Parquet/CSV)
    
- Use Docker to orchestrate all services
    

### 📁 Key Tasks:

-  Python Kafka Producer: emits 1 row/sec from 10M dataset
    
-  Flink job reads topic, parses JSON, writes output to file sink
    
-  Validate with Pandas or PySpark that sink is clean
    

### 📘 Study Topics:

- PyFlink DataStream API (minimal setup)
    
- Kafka JSON serialization
    
- Partitioning strategies for stream load
    

### 🐞 Debug Tips:

- Use Kafka UI: `kafka-ui`, `kowl` or CLI to monitor topics
    
- Simulate mini-dataset first (1000 rows)
    

---

## 🗓️ **Day 3: Data Preprocessing + EDA at Scale**

### ✅ Goals:

- Perform EDA using Dask or PySpark on processed data
    
- Implement preprocessing pipeline (scaling, windowing, feature creation)
    

### 📁 Key Tasks:

-  Create `01_eda.ipynb` → plot value trends, timestamp gaps, missing values
    
-  Convert time-series to rolling windows (LSTM-friendly)
    
-  Normalize features, encode if necessary
    

### 📘 Study Topics:

- Dask/PySpark: `map_partitions`, `repartition`, `rolling`, `groupby`
    
- Sliding windows + lag features
    
- Scaling: `StandardScaler` / `MinMaxScaler`
    

---

## 🗓️ **Day 4: Isolation Forest Baseline + Experiment Tracking**

### ✅ Goals:

- Train a fast Isolation Forest baseline model
    
- Track performance with MLflow or W&B
    
- Store metrics in `/experiments/001_iforest/metrics.json`
    

### 📁 Key Tasks:

-  Train IF on small windowed dataset
    
-  Save model using `joblib` or `pickle`
    
-  Log params + metrics (AUC, recall@k) to MLflow
    
-  Dump predictions with anomaly score
    

### 📘 Study Topics:

- Isolation Forest parameters (n_estimators, contamination)
    
- Threshold tuning based on quantiles
    
- MLflow basics (run, log_metric, log_param)
    

---

## 🗓️ **Day 5: LSTM Autoencoder Modeling**

### ✅ Goals:

- Build + train LSTM AE
    
- Track loss, reconstruction error, anomaly score
    
- Compare with IF
    

### 📁 Key Tasks:

-  Write LSTM AE class with `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`
    
-  Train on 1-week subset (to avoid memory crunch)
    
-  Save model + anomaly score threshold
    
-  Dump to `/experiments/002_lstm_autoencoder/`
    

### 📘 Study Topics:

- LSTM input shape (batch, timesteps, features)
    
- How to use MSE as reconstruction loss
    
- Learning rate schedules, early stopping
    

---

## 🗓️ **Day 6: Serving & Monitoring**

### ✅ Goals:

- Build `serve.py` using FastAPI to expose anomaly detection
    
- Add logging, error tracking, Prometheus metrics endpoint
    

### 📁 Key Tasks:

-  Write `POST /predict` API → sends time window, returns anomaly
    
-  Use `Loguru` for logging
    
-  Add `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus
    
-  Containerize model with FastAPI in Docker
    

### 📘 Study Topics:

- FastAPI model deployment
    
- Prometheus `Gauge`, `Counter` metrics
    
- Uvicorn workers + concurrency settings
    

---

## 🗓️ **Day 7: Final Polish + GitHub Delivery**

### ✅ Goals:

- Clean up repo, write docs, push final version
    
- Bonus: create demo video or short walkthrough
    

### 📁 Key Tasks:

-  Finalize `/docs/architecture.md`, `/docs/api_spec.md`
    
-  Complete `README.md` with badges, features, usage
    
-  Push Docker images (optional) + tag v1.0
    
-  Create GitHub release
    

---

# 🔁 Daily Workflow Methodology

### 📅 Your Ritual Each Day

- Start with reviewing yesterday’s commits
    
- Tackle **one major component per day**
    
- Use branches: `git checkout -b day4-lstm-modeling`
    
- Commit frequently with emojis (eg. `🚀 feat: add lstm baseline`)
    
- Run CI locally: `pytest`, `black`, `mypy` if used
    
- Push to GitHub before end of day

## ⚠️ Common Roadblocks & Fix Tips

|Problem|Fix|
|---|---|
|Kafka connection refused|Wait for `zookeeper` + broker to be fully ready; set proper host in producer|
|Dask memory crash|Use `persist()` or smaller `chunksize`|
|LSTM not learning|Normalize input, check time window size|
|Flink doesn't pick messages|Check topic name, deserialization schema|
|CI fails randomly|Use `--no-cache` for docker rebuild; rerun with logs|
