**Objective**: *Deploy the anomaly detection system to production, ensure reliability, and monitor performance in real-world conditions.*  

---

#### **Task 1: Containerization & Orchestration**  
**What to Do**:  
1. **Containerize Components**:  
   - Package models, APIs, and streaming jobs into Docker containers.  
   - Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size.  
2. **Orchestrate with Kubernetes**:  
   - Deploy containers as K8s pods (e.g., `model-serving`, `flink-jobmanager`).  
   - Configure auto-scaling (HPA) based on CPU/memory usage.  

**Tools**:  
- **Containerization**: Docker, BuildKit.  
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), Helm for templating.  

**Roadblocks**:  
- Docker image too large (>2GB).  
- Pods failing due to resource limits.  

**Debugging**:  
- Use `.dockerignore` and Alpine Linux base images.  
- Adjust K8s resource `requests/limits` in YAML manifests.  

**Example Prompt**:  
*“Deploy the FastAPI model server as a Kubernetes Deployment with 3 replicas and autoscaling.”*  

---

#### **Task 2: Monitoring & Alerting**  
**What to Do**:  
1. **Track Metrics**:  
   - Monitor model latency, throughput, and anomaly rates with Prometheus.  
   - Use Grafana dashboards to visualize SLAs (e.g., p99 latency < 200ms).  
2. **Set Alerts**:  
   - Trigger alerts for anomalies missed (recall drop) or system failures (pod crashes).  

**Tools**:  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Flink Dashboard.  
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager, Opsgenie.  

**Roadblocks**:  
- Prometheus metrics overload (cardinality explosion).  
- False alerts during traffic spikes.  

**Debugging**:  
- Use Prometheus `recording rules` to aggregate metrics.  
- Apply anomaly detection on metrics themselves (e.g., detect alert storms).  

**Learn**:  
- [Prometheus Best Practices](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/)  

---

#### **Task 3: Logging & Anomaly Auditing**  
**What to Do**:  
1. **Centralize Logs**:  
   - Aggregate logs from Flink, Kafka, and model APIs using the ELK Stack.  
2. **Audit Anomalies**:  
   - Log detected anomalies to Elasticsearch for post-hoc analysis.  

**Tools**:  
- **Logging**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Filebeat.  
- **Auditing**: Kibana dashboards for anomaly forensics.  

**Roadblocks**:  
- Log ingestion lag during peak loads.  
- Unstructured logs complicating analysis.  

**Debugging**:  
- Use Elasticsearch index lifecycle management (ILM) to archive old logs.  
- Enforce structured logging with JSON formats.  

**Example Prompt**:  
*“Create a Kibana dashboard showing hourly anomaly counts by type (spike, drop, noise).”*  

---

#### **Task 4: CI/CD Pipeline Automation**  
**What to Do**:  
1. **Automate Testing/Deployment**:  
   - Build GitHub Actions workflows to run tests, build Docker images, and deploy to staging/prod.  
2. **Canary Deployments**:  
   - Gradually roll out model updates to 5% of traffic to monitor impact.  

**Tools**:  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD (GitOps).  
- **Testing**: pytest, Locust (load tests).  

**Roadblocks**:  
- Flaky tests blocking deployments.  
- Rollbacks due to model regressions.  

**Debugging**:  
- Isolate integration tests with Docker Compose.  
- Use MLflow to track model versions and fast rollback.  

**Learn**:  
- [GitHub Actions for MLOps](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration)

#### **Task 5: Disaster Recovery & Updates**  
**What to Do**:  
1. **Backup State**:  
   - Regularly snapshot Flink checkpoints and Kafka topics to S3/GCS.  
2. **Zero-Downtime Updates**:  
   - Use Kubernetes rolling updates for model servers.  

**Tools**:  
- **Backups**: AWS Backup, Velero for K8s.  
- **Updates**: K8s `RollingUpdate` strategy, Istio for traffic shifting.  

**Roadblocks**:  
- Checkpoint corruption during restores.  
- Model version mismatches post-update.  

**Debugging**:  
- Validate backups with dry-run restores.  
- Use model API versioning (e.g., `/v1/predict`, `/v2/predict`).  

**Example Prompt**:  
*“Configure Velero to back up Flink checkpoints every 6 hours to S3.”*

### **Phase 5 Success Criteria**  
Project completion when:  
✅ System handles 10K+ events/sec with <200ms end-to-end latency.  
✅ Alerts fire within 1 minute of anomaly detection.  
✅ Zero-downtime deployments and rollbacks are validated.
