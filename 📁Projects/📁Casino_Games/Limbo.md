Okay, the user wants to create a Limbo casino game using Python, focusing on maintaining RTP (Return to Player) while ensuring it's fair and profitable for the house. Let me start by breaking down what they need.

First, they need a step-by-step guide. So I should outline the roadmap clearly. Maybe start with understanding the game mechanics, then the math model, followed by implementation, and finally some exploratory data analysis (EDA). Wait, they mentioned Plinko in the EDA part. Maybe that's a typo, but I should note that.

Understanding Limbo: It's a game where players bet on a multiplier and crash point. The game starts, a multiplier increases over time, and if it crashes before the player cashes out, they lose. The goal is to cash out before the crash. So the core is generating a fair crash point each round.

Next, the math model. The key here is the crash point distribution. It needs to be provably fair but also ensure the house edge. Typically, the crash point is determined using a cryptographic hash for fairness, but for simulation, maybe a simpler approach. The formula usually involves a uniform distribution transformed to achieve the desired house edge. For example, using X = (1 - edge) / (1 - U), where U is uniform between 0 and 1. That way, the expected value for the player is (1 - edge), maintaining RTP.

Then, RTP calculation. If the house edge is 1%, RTP is 99%. So the math model must ensure that over many bets, the average return is 99%. The crash multiplier must be calculated such that the expected payout is exactly RTP.

For the roadmap, steps would be: Research game rules, design math model with house edge, implement in Python with provable fairness (maybe using hashing for real applications), simulate bets, perform EDA to check RTP and profitability.

Implementation steps: Generate crash points using the math formula, simulate bets, calculate payouts, track RTP. Need to structure the code with classes for the game, maybe a GameRound class, and a simulator.

Wait, the user mentioned Plinko in EDA. Plinko is a different game where a ball drops through pegs. Maybe they confused the two. But since they mentioned Limbo, I'll focus on that. But perhaps in the EDA part, they want analysis similar to Plinko's distribution of outcomes. So in the EDA, simulate many rounds, analyze crash points distribution, check RTP over time, see variance, maybe house profit over time.

Potential issues: Ensuring the math model correctly reflects the desired house edge. Also, making sure the crash points are generated without bias. For real money games, cryptographic methods are used, but for simulation, a PRNG with a seed might suffice, but in real apps, they'd need a provably fair system.

Python code structure: Maybe a function to generate crash multiplier, a betting simulation loop, track results. Then use matplotlib for EDA plots.

Testing the RTP: Run a million simulations, calculate the average payout. Should be close to RTP. If the math model is correct, this should hold.

Also, considering different bet scenarios. Players might choose different multipliers. For example, a player bets on cashing out at 2x. The game crashes before 2x, they lose; otherwise, they get 2x their bet. So the probability of crash before 2x must be such that expected payout is (1 - edge).

Wait, in the formula provided earlier, if the crash multiplier is M, then the probability that M >= X (player's chosen multiplier) is (1 - edge)/X. So for a player betting on X, their chance of winning is (1 - edge)/X, and the payout is X. So expected value is X * (1 - edge)/X = 1 - edge, which matches RTP.

So the math model must ensure that the probability of the crash point being at least X is (1 - edge)/X. That way, for any X, the expected payout is (1 - edge), so RTP is 99% if edge is 1%.

So the crash point generation should be designed to have a cumulative distribution function P(M >= X) = (1 - edge)/X. The formula I thought of earlier, M = (1 - edge)/ (1 - U), where U is uniform (0,1). Let me check: If U is between 0 and 1, then 1 - U is between 0 and 1. So M = (1 - edge)/(1 - U). Then the probability that M >= X is P((1 - edge)/(1 - U) >= X) = P(1 - U <= (1 - edge)/X) = P(U >= 1 - (1 - edge)/X) = 1 - (1 - (1 - edge)/X) = (1 - edge)/X. Exactly what's needed. So that formula works.

So in code, generate U as a random number between 0 and 1, compute M = (1 - house_edge) / (1 - U). But since U can't be 1, maybe use U in [0, 1). If U is 0, M is (1-edge)/1 = 1 - edge. As U approaches 1, M approaches infinity. So the crash point is at least (1 - edge). For example, with 1% edge, the minimum crash is 0.99x, so even if the player cashes out immediately, they would lose 1% on average. Wait, but in reality, the crash starts at 1x and goes up. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, in the Limbo game, the multiplier starts at 1x and increases over time. The crash happens at some random point. So the minimum possible multiplier where it can crash is just above 1x, but according to the formula, the minimum is (1 - edge). If edge is 1%, then 0.99x. But that would mean the game can crash below 1x, which would mean the player automatically loses. But in reality, the game starts at 1x and increases. So perhaps the formula needs adjustment. Maybe the crash multiplier M is >=1, so the formula should be adjusted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-express the formula. Let's say the house edge is 'h' (e.g., 1% → h=0.01). The probability that the crash happens before multiplier X is 1 - (1 - h)/X. Therefore, for X >=1, because the game starts at 1x. So the crash multiplier M must be >=1. Therefore, the formula needs to generate M >=1. Let me adjust the formula.

Let’s define the crash multiplier M >=1. The probability that M >= X is (1 - h)/X for X >=1. Then, the CDF for M is P(M <= X) = 1 - (1 - h)/X for X >=1. The PDF would be derivative of CDF, which is (1 - h)/X². To generate such M, we can use inverse transform sampling. Let U be uniform (0,1). We want to find M such that P(M <= X) = 1 - (1 - h)/X = U. Solving for X: 1 - (1 - h)/X = U → (1 - h)/X = 1 - U → X = (1 - h)/(1 - U). Therefore, M = (1 - h)/(1 - U). Since U is in [0,1), 1 - U is in (0,1], so M is >= (1 - h). But since h is 1%, 1 - h is 0.99. But the game starts at 1x. So this would imply the crash can happen as low as 0.99x, which is below 1x. That contradicts the game's start at 1x. So there's a problem here.

Ah, I see the mistake. The original derivation assumes that the crash can happen at any multiplier, but in reality, the game starts at 1x and increases. Therefore, the crash multiplier must be at least 1x. So the formula must be adjusted. Let's re-derive it correctly.

We need the crash multiplier M >=1. The probability that M >= X is (1 - h)/X for X >=1. Then, for X=1, P(M>=1) = 1 - h, which is correct (since h is the house edge). Wait, no. Wait, if X=1, then the probability that M >=1 is 1, because the crash can't happen before 1x. So my previous approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is that the probability that the crash occurs at or above a certain multiplier X is (1 - h)/X. So for X=1, the probability that M >=1 is 1, which would require (1 - h)/1 =1 → h=0, which is not possible. So this approach is flawed.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that when the player chooses a cash-out multiplier X, the expected payout should be (1 - h) * bet. The payout is X if the crash happens after X, 0 otherwise. So expected value is X * P(M >= X) = (1 - h) → P(M >= X) = (1 - h)/X.

But in reality, the crash can't happen before 1x, so for X <=1, P(M >= X) =1. But the formula (1 - h)/X would be greater than 1 for X <1 - h. Which is impossible. Therefore, the correct way is to model P(M >= X) = min(1, (1 - h)/X) for X >=1. Because players can't cash out below 1x. Wait, but in the game, players can cash out anytime, but the crash happens after 1x. So for any cash-out X >=1, the probability that the crash is after X is (1 - h)/X. For X <1, the crash can't happen before 1x, so the player can cash out at X=1, but if they cash out before the game starts, that's a different scenario. Maybe in the game, players can only cash out once the game starts, and the crash is at M >=1. So the correct model is for X >=1, P(M >=X) = (1 - h)/X. Therefore, to generate M, we need M >=1 with P(M >=X) = (1 - h)/X.

To generate such M, the inverse transform method would work as follows:

The CDF of M is P(M <= X) = 1 - (1 - h)/X for X >=1. To generate M, solve for X in terms of a uniform random variable U:

U = 1 - (1 - h)/X → X = (1 - h)/(1 - U)

But since U is in [0,1), 1 - U is in (0,1], so X = (1 - h)/(1 - U) >= (1 - h)/1 = 1 - h. But since h is the house edge (e.g., 1%), 1 - h is 0.99. But this would imply that X can be as low as 0.99, which is below 1. But in reality, the crash can only happen at X >=1.

Therefore, there's a contradiction here. The mistake is in the initial assumption that the formula applies for all X. Let me re-express it properly.

The correct way is to set M >=1, and for X >=1, P(M >= X) = (1 - h)/X. Therefore, the crash multiplier M must be generated such that it's >=1 and follows the distribution where P(M >= X) = (1 - h)/X for X >=1.

To generate M, using inverse transform:

The CDF F(X) = P(M <= X) = 1 - (1 - h)/X for X >=1.

The inverse CDF is found by solving U = F(X) → U = 1 - (1 - h)/X → X = (1 - h)/(1 - U).

But since X must be >=1, the equation X = (1 - h)/(1 - U) must be >=1. So:

(1 - h)/(1 - U) >=1 → 1 - U <=1 - h → U >= h.

Therefore, U must be in [h, 1). But U is originally in [0,1). So for U in [0, h), we need to adjust. Wait, this suggests that the previous approach is incorrect.

Wait, if we use X = (1 - h)/(1 - U), then when U is in [0, h), X would be >=1. Because:

If U is in [0, h), then 1 - U is in (1 - h, 1]. So (1 - h)/(1 - U) <= (1 - h)/(1 - h) =1. Therefore, X <=1. But since X must be >=1, this implies that for U in [0, h), X is <=1, which is not allowed. Therefore, the correct approach is to generate U in [h, 1), and set X = (1 - h)/(1 - U). Wait, but that complicates the generation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to adjust the formula. Let's think again. The probability that M >= X is (1 - h)/X for X >=1. So when X approaches 1 from above, the probability approaches (1 - h). Which makes sense, since the house edge is h, the probability that the crash happens at or above 1x is (1 - h). Wait, but the crash must happen at or above 1x, so P(M >=1) should be 1. This is conflicting.

Ah, here's the error. The house edge comes into play in the expected payout. Let me re-express this correctly.

The expected payout for a player betting on a multiplier X (>=1) is:

E = X * P(M >= X) = (1 - h)

Therefore, P(M >= X) = (1 - h)/X.

But the crash point M must be >=1, so for X=1, P(M >=1) must be 1. But according to the formula, (1 - h)/1 = 1 - h. Which would require h=0. So this is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, maybe the house edge isn't directly applied as h, but the expected value is (1 - h). For example, if a player bets $1 and chooses X=2, then their expected payout is (1 - h). So:

E = X * P(M >= X) = 2 * P(M >=2) = (1 - h) → P(M >=2) = (1 - h)/2.

But if the player chooses X=1, then E = 1 * P(M >=1) = 1 * 1 =1, which implies no house edge. That's a problem. So the house edge can't be applied uniformly. Therefore, the correct model is that the house edge applies to each bet, regardless of the chosen X.

Alternatively, the house edge is built into the crash point distribution such that for any X, the expected payout is X * P(M >=X) = (1 - h). But this leads to a contradiction when X=1, as E would be (1 - h), implying P(M >=1) = (1 - h), which is impossible because the crash must happen at or after 1x. Therefore, the initial model is incorrect.

Alternative approach: The house edge is applied by taking a percentage of each bet. For example, the player bets 1, and the expected payout is 1*(1 - h). So regardless of the chosen X, the expected payout is (1 - h). But how is this achieved?

If the player can choose any X, then for each X, the game must have P(win) = (1 - h)/X. So for X=2, P(win) = (1 - h)/2; for X=1.5, P(win) = (1 - h)/1.5, etc. But for X=1, P(win) = (1 - h)/1 =1 - h. But since the crash happens after 1x, the player can always choose to cash out at 1x. If they do, their payout is 1x, but the probability of being able to cash out at 1x is P(M >=1) =1, which would give E=1*1=1. But the house edge requires E=1 - h. Contradiction again.

This suggests that the house edge can't be applied when the player chooses X=1. Therefore, perhaps the minimum cash-out multiplier is higher than 1, but that's not typical in Limbo games. So perhaps the correct model is that the house edge is applied via the crash distribution, which allows for a certain percentage of games to crash immediately, but in reality, the game must always reach at least 1x.

This is getting complicated. Maybe looking up how real Limbo games are designed would help. According to some sources, the crash game uses a formula where the crash multiplier is determined by M = (e / (e - (1 - house_edge))) * (1 - U), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in some implementations, the crash point is determined using a hash-based provably fair method, and the probability of crashing at any point is such that the expected value for the player is (1 - house_edge).

Another approach: The probability density function (PDF) of the crash multiplier M is f(M) = C / M², where C is a constant. The expected value of the payout is integral from M=1 to infinity of M * f(M) dM = C * integral from 1 to infinity of 1/M dM = C * [ln M] from 1 to infinity. But this integral diverges, which is a problem. So perhaps the PDF is adjusted to have a finite expected value.

Wait, but if the expected payout is to be (1 - h), then:

E[M] = integral from M=1 to M_max of M * f(M) dM = (1 - h)

But if the player can cash out at any moment, the crash happens at M, and the player's payout is M if they cash out before the crash. But in reality, the player must decide when to cash out before the crash. However, this complicates the model because the player's strategy affects their payout. To simplify, assuming the player chooses a target X, and the game crashes at M, then the payout is X if X <= M, else 0. So the expected payout is X * P(M >= X). To have this equal (1 - h) * bet, we need X * P(M >= X) = (1 - h), so P(M >= X) = (1 - h)/X.

This brings us back to the original model. But the contradiction remains for X=1. The solution must be that the minimum multiplier M is 1, and the probability that M >=1 is 1. But according to the formula, P(M >=1) = (1 - h)/1 =1 - h. Which is impossible unless h=0.

Therefore, there must be a different approach. Let me think again.

Perhaps the house edge is not applied globally but per bet. For example, regardless of the chosen X, the game takes a 1% commission on winnings. So if the player bets 1 and cashes out at X, they get X * 0.99. Then the expected payout would be 0.99 * X * P(M >= X). If the crash point M is generated such that P(M >=X) = 1/X, then the expected payout would be 0.99 * X * (1/X) = 0.99, which gives an RTP of 99%. This way, the crash point distribution is P(M >=X) =1/X, and the house takes 1% commission. This avoids the contradiction at X=1.

In this case, the crash multiplier M is generated with P(M >=X) =1/X for X >=1. This distribution has PDF f(M) =1/M² for M >=1. The expected value of M is integral from 1 to infinity M*(1/M²) dM = integral 1/M dM which diverges. But in practice, there's a maximum multiplier, say M_max, but that's another complication.

But with this approach, the house edge comes from taking a commission on the payout. The actual crash point is fair (no house edge), but the commission ensures the RTP is 1 - h. This could be a viable model.

Alternatively, the crash point is determined by M = 1 / (1 - U), where U is uniform [0,1). Then P(M >=X) = P(1/(1 - U) >=X) = P(U <=1 -1/X) =1 -1/X. So expected payout without commission is X * (1 -1/X) =X -1. To have RTP of 0.99, the house could take a commission of (X -1)*0.01 + 0.01*1? Not sure.

This is getting too tangled. Let me look for existing models. According to some sources, the crash game uses a hash-based outcome where the crash multiplier is determined by M = (1 - h) / (1 - U), where U is derived from a provably fair hash. This formula ensures that the expected value for any cash-out multiplier X is (1 - h), thus maintaining the house edge.

Wait, if M = (1 - h)/(1 - U), then for X, P(M >=X) = P((1 - h)/(1 - U) >=X) = P(1 - U <= (1 - h)/X) = P(U >=1 - (1 - h)/X) =1 - [1 - (1 - h)/X] = (1 - h)/X. Which aligns with the required probability. But then M can be as low as (1 - h), which could be below 1. For example, if h=1%, then 0.99. But the crash should happen at or after 1x.

Ah, so this model allows M to be less than 1, which contradicts the game's mechanics. Therefore, this suggests that either the model is incorrect, or the game allows for crashing below 1x, which is not the case.

Therefore, there must be a adjustment to ensure that M >=1. One way is to set M = max(1, (1 - h)/(1 - U)). But then the distribution changes. For U in [0, h), (1 - h)/(1 - U) <=1, so M=1. For U in [h, 1), M=(1 - h)/(1 - U) >=1.

Then, for X >=1, P(M >=X) = P((1 - h)/(1 - U) >=X and U >=h) + P(M=1 >=X and X<=1). Since X>=1, the second term is P(M=1 >=X) which is 1 if X=1, 0 otherwise.

Wait, this is getting complex. Let's split into cases.

If X >1:

P(M >=X) = P((1 - h)/(1 - U) >=X) = P(U >=1 - (1 - h)/X).

But since U must be >=h (because when U <h, M=1), then:

For X >1, the condition (1 - h)/(1 - U) >=X implies U >=1 - (1 - h)/X.

But 1 - (1 - h)/X must be >=h to be in the U >=h region. Let's see:

1 - (1 - h)/X >=h → (1 - h)/X <=1 -h → X >=1.

Which is always true since X>1. Therefore, for X>1:

P(M >=X) = P(U >=1 - (1 - h)/X) =1 - [1 - (1 - h)/X] = (1 - h)/X.

For X=1:

P(M >=1) = P(U >=h) + P(U <h and M=1 >=1) = (1 - h) + h =1. Which is correct.

Thus, by defining M as max(1, (1 - h)/(1 - U)), we ensure that M >=1 and for X >=1, P(M >=X) = (1 - h)/X. This resolves the contradiction.

So the correct formula is:

M = max(1, (1 - house_edge) / (1 - U)), where U is uniform [0,1).

In Python code, this would be:

import random

house_edge = 0.01 # 1%

U = random.uniform(0, 1)

M = max(1.0, (1 - house_edge) / (1 - U))

But since U can be 1.0, which would cause division by zero, we need to generate U in [0, 1), which is possible using random.random() which returns [0.0, 1.0).

So the code for generating M becomes:

U = random.random()

M = (1 - house_edge) / (1 - U) if (1 - U) > (1 - house_edge) else 1.0

Wait, because if (1 - U) <= (1 - house_edge), then (1 - house_edge)/(1 - U) >=1. Wait, no: If U is close to 1, 1 - U approaches 0, so (1 - house_edge)/(1 - U) can be very large. Wait, the max function is correct. For example, if U=0.5 and house_edge=0.01, then (1 - 0.01)/(1 -0.5)=0.99/0.5=1.98, so M=1.98. If U=0.99, (1-0.01)/(1-0.99)=0.99/0.01=99. So M=99. If U=0.0, then (0.99)/(1 -0.0)=0.99, so M=max(1.0, 0.99) → 1.0. Therefore, when U is in [0, house_edge), then (1 - h)/(1 - U) <=1. So M=1.0.

This way, the crash multiplier is at least 1.0, and for X>=1, the probability that M >=X is (1 - h)/X.

Therefore, the math model is correct with this adjustment.

Now, putting this into code: The Limbo game simulator needs to generate crash points using this formula. Then, simulate players making bets, track the RTP, ensure that over time it converges to 1 - house_edge.

For the Python implementation, create a class that generates crash points, processes bets, calculates payouts. Also, a simulation loop to run many rounds and collect data.

EDA would involve running many simulations, plotting the distribution of crash multipliers, checking the average RTP, variance, house profit over time, etc.

Potential steps in code:

1. Define the house edge and parameters.

2. Generate a crash multiplier for each round.

3. For each bet in the round (assuming multiple players), check if their chosen cash-out multiplier is less than M.

4. Calculate payout and track RTP.

5. Aggregate results over many rounds.

6. Perform EDA using histograms, line plots of RTP over time, etc.

Also, need to consider different betting strategies. For simplicity, in the simulation, perhaps assume players bet on a fixed multiplier each time, or random multipliers.

Now, let's outline the roadmap:

1. Research and Define Game Rules: Understand how Limbo works, player bets, crash mechanics.

2. Mathematical Model: Derive the crash point distribution with house edge.

3. Python Implementation:

a. Crash Multiplier Generation.

b. Bet Simulation.

c. Payout Calculation.

d. RTP Tracking.

4. EDA: Analyze simulation results, validate RTP, check profitability.

5. Optimization and Validation: Ensure the model is correct and profitable.

For the code:

- A GameRound class that generates M and processes bets.

- A simulator that runs many rounds.

- Data collection for analysis.

Testing the code with large samples (e.g., 1 million rounds) should show RTP close to 1 - house_edge.

Potential issues to handle: floating point precision, correct calculation of payouts, efficient simulation for large N.

Example code sketch:

class LimboGame:

def __init__(self, house_edge):

self.house_edge = house_edge

def generate_crash_point(self):

U = random.random()

denominator = 1 - U

if denominator == 0:

# Handle the extremely rare case where U=1.0

denominator = 1e-10 # Avoid division by zero

crash_multiplier = (1 - self.house_edge) / denominator

return max(1.0, crash_multiplier)

def simulate_round(self, player_bets):

# player_bets is a list of tuples (bet_amount, target_multiplier)

crash_point = self.generate_crash_point()

total_payout = 0

for bet_amount, target in player_bets:

if target <= crash_point:

payout = bet_amount * target

else:

payout = 0

total_payout += payout

house_profit = sum(bet for bet, _ in player_bets) - total_payout

return total_payout, house_profit

Then, simulate many rounds:

house_edge = 0.01

game = LimboGame(house_edge)

total_bets = 0

total_payout = 0

for _ in range(num_rounds):

# Assume each round has one player betting 1 unit at a random target

target = random.uniform(1, 100) # Example: random target between 1x and 100x

player_bets = [(1.0, target)]

round_payout, _ = game.simulate_round(player_bets)

total_payout += round_payout

total_bets += sum(bet for bet, _ in player_bets)

rtp = total_payout / total_bets

print(f"RTP: {rtp:.4f}")

This should yield RTP close to 0.99.

In the EDA part, we can plot the distribution of crash points, which should have a peak at 1.0 (since U in [0, house_edge) results in M=1.0). For example, with house_edge=0.01, 1% of the rounds will have M=1.0 (when U <0.01), and the rest will have M>1.0.

So the EDA would show a high frequency of crashes just above 1x, decreasing as M increases.

In conclusion, the steps are clear. Now, I need to present this in a structured way, ensuring the user gets the roadmap, math model, code, and EDA guidance.
