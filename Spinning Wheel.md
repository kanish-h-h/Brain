A digital spin wheel relies on a robust RNG (random number generator) to ensure each outcome is unpredictable and fair ​[softswiss.com](https://www.softswiss.com/knowledge-base/rng-igaming/#:~:text=Players%20want%20to%20trust%20the,has%20genuinely%20provided%20fair%20play). 

`{“Nothing”:50%, “Free Spin”:20%, “$10”:15%, “$50”:10%, “$100”:4%, “$1000”:1%}`

## **Backend weighting:** 
To implement weighted outcomes, maintain a table like “reward ⇒ probability” summing to Use a secure PRNG (crypto) to pick an outcome.

## **Trigger frequency:**
The wheel can be offered on a schedule or event basis. Common triggers include:

- **Daily login bonus:** Many social casinos give one free spin per day as part of the login reward. For example, Golden Hearts Games provides a _daily spin wheel_ for extra coins​[vegasinsider.com](https://www.vegasinsider.com/sweepstakes-casinos/daily-login-bonus/#:~:text=GOLDEN%20HEARTS%20GAMES%20,WHEEL%20FOR%20DAILY%20PRIZES). This “daily spin” model boosts retention by giving players a reason to return each day.
    
- **Play milestones or missions:** Grant a spin after the player completes game milestones or tasks. For instance, a weekly mission might be “play 100 rounds” or “wager $X total”, after which the user earns a bonus spin ​[smartico.ai](https://smartico.ai/blog-post/gamification-tactics-high-roller-online-casinos#:~:text=their%20gaming%20experience). This ties the wheel to the core loop and rewards sustained play.
    
- **Event rewards:** Special events or promotions (holidays, tournaments, new feature launches) often include spin wheels. These can give limited-time prizes or bonus tokens and drive engagement.
    
- **Win/loss streaks:** A system may award a spin after e.g. 10 consecutive losses or upon a big loss to encourage the player. This is less common but can help mitigate frustration.
    

Designing “win vs lose” odds for the wheel depends on whether “Nothing” (or a trivial prize) is possible. If you include a “no win” segment, you model it just like any prize: set its probability (say 50%) and assign reward 0 or minimal coins. In many designs every spin yields _some_ reward (even if small). Regardless, ensure the average payout fits your economy. 
For example, if prizes are coins of value _V_, expected value will be $EV = Σ(prob_i × value_i)$. To manage cost, one might set $EV$ slightly below the “cost” of the spin (e.g. 80–95% return).
